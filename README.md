## Hello, Hi

Let me introduce myself, I don't go by any names nor pronouns. Call me whatever you want or any username is provided in my account. For the past year of learning art, I'm a writer and sculptor (focusing on character build and visual). I have experience with FrontEnd programming HTML, CSS, and JavaScript experience. 
I also once testing beta games and designing (Canva & Roblox UI) mostly experimenting with color and utility.

Currently love making small project and achievements.
